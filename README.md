# LiveSplit component for therun.gg

Check out https://therun.gg/live for currently active runs!

This component does two things:

1. After every reset, it uploads your LiveSplit .lss file to therun.gg. This will automatically sync your runs with the site. No more manual uploading needed. Also works with new runs that haven't been uploaded before to the site.
2. After every split action, sends data about the current run only to therun.gg. This allows therun.gg to keep track of live runs.

## How to install

1. Download the .dll file from the latest release https://github.com/therungg/LiveSplit.TheRun/releases/latest/ or download directly here: https://github.com/therungg/LiveSplit.TheRun/releases/latest/download/LiveSplit.TheRun.dll
2. Insert the .dll file into your LiveSplit/Components directory and restart LiveSplit.
3. Edit your LiveSplit Layout. Create a new Layout entry. The component should be under the "Other"-category and is called therun.gg.
4. Login to therun.gg and hover over your name in the top-right corner. Select Upload Key (or go here: https://therun.gg/upload-key). Copy the key from the clickable box.
5. Back in LiveSplit, edit your Layout once again and select Layout Settings. On the "therun.gg" tab, insert your upload key. Select OK.

That's it! From now on, when you use this layout, your runs will automatically be uploaded to therun.gg.

## Upload Key

Make sure to keep your Upload key secret! Anyone with this key can upload runs on your behalf.

## Beta

The Component is still in beta and being tested. If you find any bugs, please let me know at info@therun.gg or through our Discord at https://discord.gg/KuAwwPsKUp.
